> 4. store questions in json file and remove from JS
> 5. section questions based off of topic and expand


## Technologies
>1. HTML5

>3. Javascript

### Prerequisites to Build - "Vanilla" PHP Front-End Game

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

### HTML and CSS

1. the HTML files  for the game isn't long code but extremely vital as everything is built based off of these containers.
Some major features included in the HTML is: 
> 1. DIV containers
> 2. buttons
> 2. text input form to gather input from user (username)

2. CSS is mainly responsible for the styling, but also positioning inluding things like hover effects, which shouldn't be confused with JavaScript functionality which can do things like change the property of an element (like the color of the container to red or green depending on the selection that the user makes)
CSS was not a highlight of this game, as functionality through vanilla PHP is the main focus, but there has been good progress made on a esponsive design for mobile, ipad, small desktop, and larger desktop.

### Javascript Functions
Javascript in this game operates mostly 

Below is a basic function used 

        startGame = () => {
          questionCounter = 0;
          score = 0;
          availableQuestions = [...questions];
          console.log(availableQuestions);
          getNewQuestion();
        };



## Manipulating the DOM
Manipulating the DOM is the most crucial part of the game because as the user continues the game, not only do the functions need to work but things other than the Javascript will need to be changed.
For example, in this below snippet:

    saveScore = e => {
        e.preventDefault();

        const score = {
            score: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
            name: username.value
        };
        highScores.push(score);
        highScores.push((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
        highScores.splice(5);

        localStorage.setItem("highScores", JSON.stringify(highScores));
        window.location.assign("index.html");
    };
Because the user's score will be unique to that specific that game that was played, this can not be a predetermined number so based on the score, this number is then displayed in the HTML of the page all within one function in Javascript by manipulating the DOM.

Ways utilized DOM manipulation for the game
> 1. Changes properties of HTML elments from JS file
> 2. Create HTMLS classLists
> 3. Change CSS style propoerties
> 4. Use API storage to gather and store input/data from users
