## Features
1. BRONZE:  significant progress.
> 1. Make the app functional
> 2. make the app look most like the mock - in simplest form

2. SILVER: in progress.
>1. add additional festures
>2. build upon library

3. Gold: INCOMPLETEâ€¼
> 1. 
> 2. 


## Technologies
>1. React
>2. Storybook

### Prerequisites to Build - "Vanilla" PHP Front-End Game

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

### REACT 

React allows developers to spend less time making tedious and/or repetitive codes and adjustments across projects by allowing pieces of code to be stored into a library.
Some major features included in the HTML is: 
> 1. button
> 2. headers
> 2. pages
> 4. text-input (collect password from users)



#### Component Libraries
Javascript in this game operates mostly on functions

Below is a basic function.

        startGame = () => {
          questionCounter = 0;
          score = 0;
          availableQuestions = [...questions];
          console.log(availableQuestions);
          getNewQuestion();
        };



## Storybook
Using storybook is slightly different than React alone. 

For example, in this below snippet:

    saveScore = e => {
        e.preventDefault();

        const score = {
            score: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
            name: username.value
        };
        highScores.push(score);
        highScores.push((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
        highScores.splice(5);

        localStorage.setItem("highScores", JSON.stringify(highScores));
        window.location.assign("index.html");
    };
Because the user's score will be unique to that specific that game that was played, this can not be a predetermined number so based on the score, this number is then displayed in the HTML of the page all within one function in Javascript by manipulating the DOM.

Ways utilized DOM manipulation for the game
> 1. Changes properties of HTML elments from JS file
> 2. Create HTMLS classLists
> 3. Change CSS style propoerties
> 4. Use API storage to gather and store input/data from users
